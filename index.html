        <summary><h2>About Us</h2></summary>
        <p><strong>We know you don't know us yet, so here's a little about our journey.</strong></p>
        <p>Not long ago, we made one of the biggest decisions of our lives: to start over in Canada. With our hearts pounding, we packed our entire lives into just four suitcases. Along with our two cats, we set out to write a new story—together. With nerves, hope, and many dreams, we landed in this amazing country, ready to begin again.
          Today, we live in the Niagara region. Adapting hasn't been easy, and finding work has been one of our biggest challenges. But instead of giving up, we chose to try something different. Because we believe in the power of genuine connections—the kind that change lives. That’s why we invite you to be part of this new chapter in our story.
